**My First Post on github!**
===================
----------
Hello my name is sebastian, at the begining of this post i'm going to introduce myself. As i wrote before, my name is sebastian i'm twenty two years old, i'm studying mechatronic engineer,  and i'm really motivated to be here participating on this site and in this project. I like to work with electronic devices like embedded systems, microcontrolers, analog electronic, i like robots and to design printed boards.
This is a challenge to me because iâ€™ve never work in this kind of projects but i hope that this will be a good experience.
